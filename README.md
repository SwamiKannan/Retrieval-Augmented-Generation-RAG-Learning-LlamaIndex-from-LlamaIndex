# Learn LlamaIndex using a Llama Index helper

## Introduction

I was trying to learn Llama Index and was getting a little frustrated by the syntax since it was a bit different from LangChain (with storage context and service context and stuff). Hence, to start it off, I decided to first build a RAG to build a chat assistant that helps me with LlamaIndex.
